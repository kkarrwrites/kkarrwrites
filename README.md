## Summary

- Hello! My name is K. Karr. I'm a copy editor turned web developer.
- I got my start writing HTML on Expage, GeoCities, and LiveJournal in high school.
- After collecting a few degrees, living abroad for two years, and cutting my teeth as a copy editor for nearly a decade, I returned to web development out of a strong desire to learn more about the technologies I use every day.
